This is a small graphics demo written in Java that features
a simple triangle rasterization algorithm. The demo was
posted along with an article at: http://joshbeam.com/

This demo was developed and tested using the JDK that is
included with Mac OS X 10.6.4.

To build the demo, just run 'ant jar' from within the
directory containing the source code. This will create a
jar file called TriangleRaster.jar that you can then run.
If you don't have ant installed, you can obtain it from:

    http://ant.apache.org/

Alternatively, you can compile and run the demo by running
the following commands from within the directory containing
the source code:

    javac *.java
    java TriangleRaster

Press the 'Escape' key to exit the demo.
